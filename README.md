# Cherry_Blossom_24

This repository contains all code / data / results of my contribution to this year's cherry blossom prediction contest. The html-document Cherry_Blossom_24_RF.html contains a rendered version of all code with acompanying plots and texts to illustrate my procedure. Unfortunately, it is not always presented in the correct way. Therefore, you can also assess it via this github pages link: https://lunafrauhammer.github.io/Cherry_Blossom_24/CompletePrediction

This document was created by the respective document Cherry_Blossom_24_RF.qmd which contains all R code and is stored in the CherryBlossom24 folder. 

To run the R code, the working directory must be set to the CherryBlossom24 folder. 

CherryBlossom.csv contains my predictions.
