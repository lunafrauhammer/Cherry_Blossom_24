# Cherry_Blossom_24

This repository contains all code / data / results of my contribution to this year's cherry blossom prediction contest. The html-document Cherry_Blossom_24_RF.html contains a rendered version of all code with acompanying plots and texts to illustrate my procedure. This document was created by the respective Quarto document Cherry_Blossom_24_RF.qmd which contains all R code. 

To run the R code, the working directory must be set to the CherryBlossom24 folder. 

CherryBlossom.csv contains my predictions.
